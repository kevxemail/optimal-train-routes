## Optimal Train Routes

- Utilizes the Chicago Train Authority's dataset on train station coordinates as well as junctions to create a map of the United State's train routes on tkinter
- Optimizes train routes from city to city using A* Search with an implementation of the Great Circle Distance heuristic
- Additionally has the option to see how other searching algorithms such as Djikstra's, BFS, and DFS perform
